[{"content":"This project is one of the data science challenge posted on Kaggle and I decided to jump on it. It is about creating a predictive macine Learning model that predicts which passengers are likely to survive the titanic Shipwreck. We all know the story behind the famous titanic ship. But just incase you don\u0026rsquo;t know the story behind Titanic, let me give you a brief gist 😉. Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of its completion in 1912. Designed to carry 2,435 passengers plus roughly 900 crew. Passengers were divided into three classes, reflecting the social stratification of the time. Titanic set sail from Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912, bound for New York City. It stopped briefly in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, to pick up additional passengers. Titanic’s wireless operators received multiple iceberg warnings from other ships. Although, the crew was aware of ice in the vicinity, they maintained speed hoping to arrive earlier. On the night of April 14, 1912, at around 11:40 p.m. ship’s time, despite evasive maneuvers, Titanic scraped along the iceberg’s starboard side causing punctures below the waterline. Five of the ship’s watertight compartments were compromised. Over about two hours and forty minutes, the bow sank deeper until the stern rose out of the water. An estimated 1500-1517. A disproportionate number of third-class passengers and crew lost their lives compared to first-class passengers, reflecting class-based access to lifeboats. Around 705 people survived. Many were taken aboard the Cunard liner Carpathia, which arrived at the scene after receiving Titanic’s distress signals.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dive into the brief steps of how I handled this project using anaconda jupyter notebook and tableau. We will get the data, explore, process, and build the ML models. We will then depoly the model using TabPy function and see the results in tableau. You can access the datasource here - Titanic dataset on Kaggle. The demographic characteristics are the independent variables.\nstep 1: I got data from kaggle.

The requirement(s) was to build an Ecommerce dashboard with data sources from Shopify, Google Analytics, and local database.\nThe tools used for the project are listed below:\nJupyter Google console (console.cloud.google) Ga-dev-tools (ga-dev-tools) Snowflake I will give a brief summary of the steps involved in the project from start to finish.\nStep 1 : I was to reveiw the front end of these applications and identify the key metrics that were needed. Step 2 : After identifying these data sources, a plan was drafted on how to get these data out of the applications. The data was gotten from the shopify api, google analytics api 4 (GA4), oracle, and snowflake databases. Step 3 : I connected to the GA4 developers console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) to create my method of authentication. I used Oauth 2.0 client IDs for my authentication since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a service account and running this on my pc. The basic steps are : Go to the Google Cloud Console (have the property id ready). Navigate to APIs \u0026amp; Services \u0026gt; Credentials. Click on Create Credentials and select OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. Configure the consent screen and download the JSON file containing your client ID and client secret. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to Set the default Ips in the redirect URIs 🙂.\u0026rdquo; Next, run this script below to generate your access token.

Please authenticate manually first.\u0026#34;) # Save updated credentials (with refreshed token) with open(TOKEN_PATH, \u0026#34;w\u0026#34;) as token_file: token_file.write(creds.to_json()) return creds # Get authenticated credentials credentials = get_credentials() client = BetaAnalyticsDataClient(credentials=credentials) Note: If yor python environment is having outdated widgets especially using jupyter, this could cause some errors. Step 4 : I used the dev tools query explorer to select the dimensions and metrics I needed and ran the request to see the response. Step 5 : I wrote my script and kept modifying until completed. This script connected to snowflake; extracted, transformed some fields, and Loaded data into the already created snowflake table. After these, next is to create a task for daily data update. Amongst the multiple ways to update data, I opted for windows task scheduler. I found this option more convenient considering the resources I have available. The snowflake connector needs to be installed by running. 1 pip install snowflake-connector-python There\u0026rsquo;s also need to setup the following : - User: - Password: - Account: - Warehouse: - Database: - Schema:\nNote: GA4 default limit is 10000 rows. you can use pagination (limit and offset) to get more rows.

It is about creating a predictive macine Learning model that predicts which passengers are likely to survive the titanic Shipwreck. We all know the story behind the famous titanic ship. But just incase you don\u0026rsquo;t know the story behind Titanic, let me give you a brief gist 😉. Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of its completion in 1912. Designed to carry 2,435 passengers plus roughly 900 crew. Passengers were divided into three classes, reflecting the social stratification of the time. Titanic set sail from Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912, bound for New York City. It stopped briefly in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, to pick up additional passengers. Titanic’s wireless operators received multiple iceberg warnings from other ships. Although, the crew was aware of ice in the vicinity, they maintained speed hoping to arrive earlier. On the night of April 14, 1912, at around 11:40 p.m. ship’s time, despite evasive maneuvers, Titanic scraped along the iceberg’s starboard side causing punctures below the waterline. Five of the ship’s watertight compartments were compromised. Over about two hours and forty minutes, the bow sank deeper until the stern rose out of the water. An estimated 1500-1517. A disproportionate number of third-class passengers and crew lost their lives compared to first-class passengers, reflecting class-based access to lifeboats. Around 705 people survived. Many were taken aboard the Cunard liner Carpathia, which arrived at the scene after receiving Titanic’s distress signals.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dive into the brief steps of how I handled this project using anaconda jupyter notebook and tableau. We will get the data, explore, process, and build the ML models. We will then depoly the model using TabPy function and see the results in tableau.

It is about creating a predictive macine Learning model that predicts which passengers are likely to survive the titanic Shipwreck.\nWe all know the story behind the famous titanic ship. But just incase you don\u0026rsquo;t know the story behind Titanic, let me give you a brief gist 😉.\nTitanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of its completion in 1912. Designed to carry 2,435 passengers plus roughly 900 crew. Passengers were divided into three classes, reflecting the social stratification of the time.\nTitanic set sail from Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912, bound for New York City. It stopped briefly in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, to pick up additional passengers.\nTitanic’s wireless operators received multiple iceberg warnings from other ships. Although, the crew was aware of ice in the vicinity, they maintained speed hoping to arrive earlier.\nOn the night of April 14, 1912, at around 11:40 p.m. ship’s time, despite evasive maneuvers, Titanic scraped along the iceberg’s starboard side causing punctures below the waterline. Five of the ship’s watertight compartments were compromised.\nOver about two hours and forty minutes, the bow sank deeper until the stern rose out of the water. An estimated 1500-1517. A disproportionate number of third-class passengers and crew lost their lives compared to first-class passengers, reflecting class-based access to lifeboats. Around 705 people survived. Many were taken aboard the Cunard liner Carpathia, which arrived at the scene after receiving Titanic’s distress signals.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"First"},{"content":"This project was an interesting one. The requirement(s) was to build an Ecommerce dashboard with data sources from Shopify, Google Analytics, and local database.\nThe tools used for the project are listed below:\nJupyter Google console (console.cloud.google) Ga-dev-tools (ga-dev-tools) Snowflake I will give a brief summary of the steps involved in the project from start to finish.\nStep 1 : I was to reveiw the front end of these applications and identify the key metrics that were needed. Step 2 : After identifying these data sources, a plan was drafted on how to get these data out of the applications. The data was gotten from the shopify api, google analytics api 4 (GA4), oracle, and snowflake databases. Step 3 : I connected to the GA4 developers console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) to create my method of authentication. I used Oauth 2.0 client IDs for my authentication since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a service account and running this on my pc. The basic steps are : Go to the Google Cloud Console (have the property id ready). Navigate to APIs \u0026amp; Services \u0026gt; Credentials. Click on Create Credentials and select OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. Configure the consent screen and download the JSON file containing your client ID and client secret. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to Set the default Ips in the redirect URIs 🙂.\u0026rdquo; Next, run this script below to generate your access token.

Step 4 : I used the dev tools query explorer to select the dimensions and metrics I needed and ran the request to see the response. Step 5 : I wrote my script and kept modifying until completed. This script connected to snowflake; extracted, transformed some fields, and Loaded data into the already created snowflake table. After these, next is to create a task for daily data update. Amongst the multiple ways to update data, I opted for windows task scheduler. I found this option more convenient considering the resources I have available. The snowflake connector needs to be installed by running. 1 pip install snowflake-connector-python There\u0026rsquo;s also need to setup the following : - User: - Password: - Account: - Warehouse: - Database: - Schema:\nNote: GA4 default limit is 10000 rows. you can use pagination (limit and offset) to get more rows.

It is about creating a predictive macine Learning model that predicts which passengers are likely to survive the titanic Shipwreck. We all know the story behind the famous titanic ship. But just incase you don\u0026rsquo;t know the story behind Titanic, let me give you a brief gist 😉. Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of its completion in 1912. Designed to carry 2,435 passengers plus roughly 900 crew. Passengers were divided into three classes, reflecting the social stratification of the time. Titanic set sail from Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912, bound for New York City. It stopped briefly in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, to pick up additional passengers. Titanic’s wireless operators received multiple iceberg warnings from other ships. Although, the crew was aware of ice in the vicinity, they maintained speed hoping to arrive earlier. On the night of April 14, 1912, at around 11:40 p.m. ship’s time, despite evasive maneuvers, Titanic scraped along the iceberg’s starboard side causing punctures below the waterline. Five of the ship’s watertight compartments were compromised. Over about two hours and forty minutes, the bow sank deeper until the stern rose out of the water. An estimated 1500-1517. A disproportionate number of third-class passengers and crew lost their lives compared to first-class passengers, reflecting class-based access to lifeboats. Around 705 people survived. Many were taken aboard the Cunard liner Carpathia, which arrived at the scene after receiving Titanic’s distress signals.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dive into the brief steps of how I handled this project using anaconda jupyter notebook and tableau.

It is about creating a predictive macine Learning model that predicts which passengers are likely to survive the titanic Shipwreck.\nWe all know the story behind the famous titanic ship. But just incase you don\u0026rsquo;t know the story behind Titanic, let me give you a brief gist 😉.\nTitanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of its completion in 1912. Designed to carry 2,435 passengers plus roughly 900 crew. Passengers were divided into three classes, reflecting the social stratification of the time.\nTitanic set sail from Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912, bound for New York City. It stopped briefly in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, to pick up additional passengers.\nTitanic’s wireless operators received multiple iceberg warnings from other ships. Although, the crew was aware of ice in the vicinity, they maintained speed hoping to arrive earlier.\nOn the night of April 14, 1912, at around 11:40 p.m. ship’s time, despite evasive maneuvers, Titanic scraped along the iceberg’s starboard side causing punctures below the waterline. Five of the ship’s watertight compartments were compromised.\nOver about two hours and forty minutes, the bow sank deeper until the stern rose out of the water. An estimated 1500-1517. A disproportionate number of third-class passengers and crew lost their lives compared to first-class passengers, reflecting class-based access to lifeboats. Around 705 people survived. Many were taken aboard the Cunard liner Carpathia, which arrived at the scene after receiving Titanic’s distress signals.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"First"},{"content":"This project was an interesting one. The requirement(s) was to build an Ecommerce dashboard with data sources from Shopify, Google Analytics, and local database.\nThe tools used for the project are listed below:\nJupyter Google console (console.cloud.google) Ga-dev-tools (ga-dev-tools) Snowflake I will give a brief summary of the steps involved in the project from start to finish.\nStep 1 : I was to reveiw the front end of these applications and identify the key metrics that were needed. Step 2 : After identifying these data sources, a plan was drafted on how to get these data out of the applications. The data was gotten from the shopify api, google analytics api 4 (GA4), oracle, and snowflake databases. Step 3 : I connected to the GA4 developers console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) to create my method of authentication. I used Oauth 2.0 client IDs for my authentication since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a service account and running this on my pc. The basic steps are : Go to the Google Cloud Console (have the property id ready). Navigate to APIs \u0026amp; Services \u0026gt; Credentials. Click on Create Credentials and select OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. Configure the consent screen and download the JSON file containing your client ID and client secret. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to Set the default Ips in the redirect URIs 🙂.\u0026rdquo; Next, run this script below to generate your access token.

Step 4 : I used the dev tools query explorer to select the dimensions and metrics I needed and ran the request to see the response. Step 5 : I wrote my script and kept modifying until completed. This script connected to snowflake; extracted, transformed some fields, and Loaded data into the already created snowflake table. After these, next is to create a task for daily data update. Amongst the multiple ways to update data, I opted for windows task scheduler. I found this option more convenient considering the resources I have available.

It is about creating a predictive macine Learning model that predicts which passengers are likely to survive the titanic Shipwreck.\rWe all know the story behind the famous titanic ship. But just incase you don't know the story behind Titanic, let me give you a brief gist 😉.\rTitanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of its completion in 1912. Designed to carry 2,435 passengers plus roughly 900 crew. Passengers were divided into three classes, reflecting the social stratification of the time.\rTitanic set sail from Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912, bound for New York City. It stopped briefly in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, to pick up additional passengers.\rTitanic’s wireless operators received multiple iceberg warnings from other ships. Although, the crew was aware of ice in the vicinity, they maintained speed hoping to arrive earlier.\rOn the night of April 14, 1912, at around 11:40 p.m. ship’s time, despite evasive maneuvers, Titanic scraped along the iceberg’s starboard side causing punctures below the waterline. Five of the ship’s watertight compartments were compromised.\rOver about two hours and forty minutes, the bow sank deeper until the stern rose out of the water. An estimated 1500-1517. A disproportionate number of third-class passengers and crew lost their lives compared to first-class passengers, reflecting class-based access to lifeboats. Around 705 people survived. Many were taken aboard the Cunard liner Carpathia, which arrived at the scene after receiving Titanic’s distress signals.\rLet's dive into the brief steps of how I handled this project using anaconda jupyter notebook and tableau.

It is about creating a predictive macine Learning model that predicts which passengers are likely to survive the titanic Shipwreck.\r\nWe all know the story behind the famous titanic ship. But just incase you don't know the story behind Titanic, let me give you a brief gist 😉.\r\nTitanic was the largest ship afloat at the time of its completion in 1912. Designed to carry 2,435 passengers plus roughly 900 crew. Passengers were divided into three classes, reflecting the social stratification of the time.\r\nTitanic set sail from Southampton, England, on April 10, 1912, bound for New York City. It stopped briefly in Cherbourg, France, and Queenstown (now Cobh), Ireland, to pick up additional passengers.\r\nTitanic’s wireless operators received multiple iceberg warnings from other ships. Although, the crew was aware of ice in the vicinity, they maintained speed hoping to arrive earlier.\r\nOn the night of April 14, 1912, at around 11:40 p.m. ship’s time, despite evasive maneuvers, Titanic scraped along the iceberg’s starboard side causing punctures below the waterline. Five of the ship’s watertight compartments were compromised.\r\nOver about two hours and forty minutes, the bow sank deeper until the stern rose out of the water. An estimated 1500-1517. A disproportionate number of third-class passengers and crew lost their lives compared to first-class passengers, reflecting class-based access to lifeboats. Around 705 people survived. Many were taken aboard the Cunard liner Carpathia, which arrived at the scene after receiving Titanic’s distress signals.\r\nLet's dive into the brief steps of how I handled this project using anaconda jupyter notebook and tableau. We will get the data, explore, process, and build the ML models. We will then depoly the model using TabPy function and see the results in tableau.\r\nYou can access the datasource here - [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset on Kaggle.

The requirement(s) was to build an Ecommerce dashboard with data sources from Shopify, Google Analytics, and local database.\nThe tools used for the project are listed below:\nJupyter Google console (console.cloud.google) Ga-dev-tools (ga-dev-tools) Snowflake I will give a brief summary of the steps involved in the project from start to finish.\nStep 1 : I was to reveiw the front end of these applications and identify the key metrics that were needed. Step 2 : After identifying these data sources, a plan was drafted on how to get these data out of the applications. The data was gotten from the shopify api, google analytics api 4 (GA4), oracle, and snowflake databases. Step 3 : I connected to the GA4 developers console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) to create my method of authentication. I used Oauth 2.0 client IDs for my authentication since I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a service account and running this on my pc. The basic steps are : Go to the Google Cloud Console (have the property id ready). Navigate to APIs \u0026amp; Services \u0026gt; Credentials. Click on Create Credentials and select OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. Configure the consent screen and download the JSON file containing your client ID and client secret. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to Set the default Ips in the redirect URIs 🙂.\u0026rdquo; Next, run this script below to generate your access token. This will automatically download on the specified path. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 import os import json from google.auth.transport.requests import Request from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials from google.analytics.data_v1beta import BetaAnalyticsDataClient # Path to your OAuth credentials JSON OAUTH_JSON_PATH = \u0026#34;C:\\\\Users\\\\Downloads\\\\Python\\\\Oauth_Credentials.json\u0026#34; TOKEN_PATH = \u0026#34;C:\\\\Users\\\\Downloads\\\\Python\\\\token.json\u0026#34; def get_credentials(): creds = None # Load existing credentials if available if os.path.exists(TOKEN_PATH): creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file(TOKEN_PATH) # If there are no valid credentials, authenticate using OAuth JSON if not creds or not creds.valid: if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token: creds.refresh(Request()) # Refresh token automatically else: raise Exception(\u0026#34;❌ OAuth credentials have expired or are missing. Please authenticate manually first.\u0026#34;) # Save updated credentials (with refreshed token) with open(TOKEN_PATH, \u0026#34;w\u0026#34;) as token_file: token_file.write(creds.to_json()) return creds # Get authenticated credentials credentials = get_credentials() client = BetaAnalyticsDataClient(credentials=credentials) Note: If yor python environment is having outdated widgets especially using jupyter, this could cause some errors. Step 4 : I used the dev tools query explorer to select the dimensions and metrics I needed and ran the request to see the response. Step 5 : I wrote my script and kept modifying until completed. This script connected to snowflake; extracted, transformed some fields, and Loaded data into the already created snowflake table. After these, next is to create a task for daily data update. Amongst the multiple ways to update data, I opted for windows task scheduler. I found this option more convenient considering the resources I have available. The snowflake connector needs to be installed by running. 1 pip install snowflake-connector-python There\u0026rsquo;s also need to setup the following : - User: - Password: - Account: - Warehouse: - Database: - Schema:\nNote: GA4 default limit is 10000 rows. you can use pagination (limit and offset) to get more rows.
